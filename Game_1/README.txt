Game inspired by Jabrils, link to the video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hP5wbpJOpQ

Instead of a simple blinking of lights, we have a song playing notes notifiing what score you are currently at. 
The goal is to complete the song.
Code for an Arduino Uno R3 built with an passive Buzzer for sound, two buttons and a 74HC595 chip.
Rules :
	You need to press the button when the opposite green LED lights up.
	First to complete the song wins
	Each time a button is pressed, the speed the light travels takes a random value.
