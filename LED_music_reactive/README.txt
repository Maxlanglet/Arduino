Animated LED strip with RGB color variation, based on volume and the frequency after Fast Fourier Transform.
Implemented with an IR remote, couldn't get the buttons to work so it's a simple cycle through animations plus the music reactive animation.
First color isn't white because I think the light colors interfere with the IR remote and detects an IR signal and cycles on
so changed the color so that didn't happen.
